## Formally verified leapfrog integration of the simple harmonic oscillator

The Stormer-Verlet ("leapfrog") method is a numerical method for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). 

This repository contains Coq proofs for the formal verification of a C implementation of leapfrog integration of the simple harmonic oscillator. 

A dependency graph for our theorems in the [leapfrog_project](https://github.com/VeriNum/VerifiedLeapfrog/tree/main/leapfrog_project) directory can be found in the project [paper](https://github.com/VeriNum/VerifiedLeapfrog).
